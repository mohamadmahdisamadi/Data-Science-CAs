    Explanation: The reviewer states the first part of the movie was mostly ""talk, and more talk."" They criticize the movie for losing the viewer's attention as the movie progresses due to excessive dialogue instead of more excitement related to the ""thriller"" genre. Although the reviewer mentions a positive aspect i.e., about the cast, the overall tone of the review is negative. Also, user refers to ""this movie"" as a ""chick flick and little else"", also indicating a negative view of the film. Therefore, the review can be identified as negative.

    ### Question: Is this review positive or negative?
    Thank you for making this film available on demand. I genuinely enjoyed it and feel that it has done a great job of honoring the spirit of the source materials while casting a new light on them. It may not have completely worked for me to see it in theatres, as I found myself quite distracted at times by sound production levels that were too high to ignore. I look forward to seeing this talented cast perform together again soon.
    Answer: Positive.

- Explanation: The review provided is overwhelmingly complimentary towards the movie. The reviewer praises various aspects such as the design, set, lighting, sound, plot, and script. The performance of the actor, Paxton, is also mentioned positively highlighting his mannerisms and vocal tones. Further, phrases like ""very well polished,"" ""gem,"" and ""not for the simple mind"" suggest that the reviewer found great detail and complexity in the movie which they feel may not be appreciated universally, but is commendable nonetheless. Thus, when taking into account all of the positive aspects mentioned, it's safe to conclude this review is positive.

- solution: The review provided is negative for several reasons:

1. **Critique of Predictability and Boredom:** The reviewer states that the movie was ""boring, totally predictable"" and criticizes its premise by noting that it scared them as a child but now ""just bores me."" This indicates a general lack of appeal or excitement.

2. **Discontent with Acting:** A significant part of the review is dedicated to the acting, which the reviewer found to be ""horrible."" The actors are said to be ""expressionless boring"" which suggests that the reviewer found no emotional engagement in the performances.

- [Answer]: The tone of this review is clearly negative. The reviewer starts by stating that the presence of highly acclaimed actors—Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs—is wasted in the movie ""Three Days to Vegas,"" according to them. They criticize the script by mentioning that it is shallow, which they believe cheats both the actors and the audience. The reviewer explicitly states that there are no redeeming factors to the film, suggesting that the only positive aspects are the performances of the esteemed actors acting against a backdrop that doesn't reward them, which they consider a 'crime'. While the reviewer states that they wanted to like it, they follow that up by saying it's a crime to enjoy such a film, cementing the negative tone of the review.",0,False

- support: The review is negative for several reasons. The reviewer states initially that they are rarely a fan of rom-coms. Then, they feel this particular movie is just ""more of the same but less,"" suggesting disappointment and lack of originality or quality. 

Furthermore, they express dissatisfaction with the pacing, explicitly stating they expected more humor but found just one substantial laugh-out-loud moment throughout the film. The mention of a forced laugh incurring from a male friend also contributes to an evident negativity in tone around the film's emotional effectiveness.

Additionally, the reviewer warns other potential viewers in the very last line. The phrasing is quite strong, saying that they 'guarantee' and 'ensure' there are better movies available. Therefore, their recommendation is clear: not to go see this film.

- Solution: The review is clearly negative. The reviewer uses strong negative language throughout to describe their experience and the content of the movie. They label it as ""the worst Christmas movie [they've] ever seen,"" which immediately sets a very unfavorable tone. The details provided about the story - such as a dark and miserable plot involving a bank heist, the death of a child, and the loss of other family members - are intended to emphasize their disappointment. They express concern over the message the movie conveys to children, a subject they consider particularly significant.

- Response: Upon examining the provided text, we can discern certain cues that suggest the sentiment being expressed is positive. The key phrases here are ""noted to add,"" which generally denotes a constructive contribution to a previous comment, and ""vastly the superior,"" which directly states that one work (Black Hat) is better than another (CB4). The use of ""vastly"" amplifies the degree of superiority, adding to the strong positive sentiment. Additionally, there seems to be no overt critical language or clearly identified negative aspects being highlighted as there might have been in other cases.

- ai: The review touches upon several aspects of the movie and provides a mixed analysis, praising the performance of an actor and the lack of overexcitement, character interest, and visual elements. However, it also contains several criticisms like the slow development, lack of realism, and predictability. The reviewer did not express strong negative feelings and indicated the movie is bearable, watchable, and better than most TV shows. They find the movie good to watch after dinner. Such ambivalence in reviving aspects on both ends requires reading to the last line when the reviewer compares the watchability to most TV shows implying it's above average, which leans more towards a positive review, thus making this review positive.

I have seen a total of fifty movies in a row at the same cinema, this weekend. Some may think this is an awful idea, but I can assure you that is absolutely, positively not the case. Most moviegoers might say it seems a little foolish and crazy, but for me, having an entertainment binge, especially in the confines of a single theater, is as much fun as it is exhausting. I guarantee you that watching such a huge mass of movies back to back would put me in much mood better than a day at the library or",1,True
